# about your new image collection

The `cats-human-situations.csv` file contains metadata for four  image objects.
The original metadata from the source institutions has been abbreviated and made
messier so you have something to clean up! My name is Stacy!

The associated images are in the /images directory

Cleanup plan:
- fix shouty caps
- standardize dates
- standardize dimensions
